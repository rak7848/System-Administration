# System-Administration

The Systems Administration course provides fundamental skills needed to manage and configure IT infrastructure. Developed practical skills by carrying out virtual networking implementations and Active Directory administration in combination with RAID system assembly and file-sharing protocols (FTP, Samba, RSYNC, NFS). Fundamental version control principles of Git are taught to the students within the course curriculum.

Must employ RLES to arrange virtual systems and manage network system components.

Active Directory enables users to manage entities including users and groups as well as policies while enabling DNS and DHCP service configuration.

The implementation includes RAID 1 and RAID 5 setup while configuring file systems followed by storage server management.

Establish FTP services and Samba features and RSYNC and NFS protocols to permit file sharing between different computing platforms.

Newcomers should understand how Git enables version control systems to collaborate and manage their source code.

All practical concepts and configured components from the final project are documented in the Site Book while focusing on real-world security and troubleshooting scenarios. System Administration Provides useful skills dealing with systems administration together with network security and server management basics during this training program.
